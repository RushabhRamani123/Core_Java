| **Step**                                      | **Description**                                                             | **Significance (Why It Matters)**                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Write Source Code (.java)**              | Developer writes code using Java syntax and saves it in a `.java` file.     | It's the human-readable logic that defines what your program will do. This is the starting point of any Java program.                               |
| **2. Compile Code (`javac HelloWorld.java`)** | Java compiler translates the `.java` file into bytecode, saved as `.class`. | The bytecode is platform-independent, allowing Java to be **"write once, run anywhere"**. Also, compilation catches **syntax errors** early.        |
| **3. Generate Bytecode (.class)**             | The `.class` file contains Java bytecode.                                   | Bytecode is a **portable intermediate language**. It can be executed on any platform that has a compatible JVM.                                     |
| **4. Load into JVM (`java HelloWorld`)**      | JVM (Java Virtual Machine) loads the bytecode.                              | The JVM abstracts away the hardware/OS, allowing Java to run on **any system** with a JVM. It also manages **memory, security, and threading**.     |
| **5. ClassLoader**                            | JVM uses a ClassLoader to load classes into memory.                         | It **dynamically loads** required classes during runtime, supporting modular and flexible application design.                                       |
| **6. Bytecode Verifier**                      | Ensures bytecode is safe and does not violate Javaâ€™s security rules.        | Prevents malicious code from corrupting memory or breaching security. Essential for running **untrusted code**, like applets or downloaded modules. |
| **7. Execution Begins at `main()`**           | JVM looks for the `main(String[] args)` method to start execution.          | The `main` method is the **entry point** of every standalone Java application.                                                                      |
| **8. Interpreter / JIT Compilation**          | JVM interprets bytecode or compiles it into native machine code using JIT.  | **JIT** boosts performance by compiling frequently used code to native instructions at runtime, reducing execution time.                            |
| **9. Execution and Output**                   | The final native code runs on the machine and outputs the result.           | You see the **actual result** of your program (e.g., console output, calculations, etc.).                                                           |
